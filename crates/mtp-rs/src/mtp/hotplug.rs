/// # What the stream guarantees
///
/// - **Devices already plugged in when watching starts arrive as [`HotplugEvent::Arrived`]**, before
///   any live event. So a consumer needs one code path, not an enumerate-then-watch pair, and a
///   device plugged in during startup can't slip through the gap between the two. Consumers must not
///   enumerate separately as well, or they'll count those devices twice.
/// - **[`HotplugEvent::Left`] carries the full [`MtpDeviceInfo`]** of the device that went away,
///   including its serial. The OS reports only an opaque id on disconnect, so the watch caches what
///   it last saw; without that a consumer can't tell which of two phones was unplugged.
/// - **A device that changes identity in place** (a phone switching from charge-only to file
///   transfer, which re-enumerates it with new descriptors) is reported as a `Left` for the old
///   identity followed by an `Arrived` for the new one.
/// - **The stream never ends on its own**; it stays live until dropped. Dropping it stops the
///   notifications and any later device changes are missed, so a consumer tracking devices for the
///   lifetime of a process should hold it for that long.
///
/// # Scope
///
/// USB only. Virtual devices (feature `virtual-device`) are registered in-process rather than
/// plugged in, so they never produce hotplug events even though `list_devices` includes them.
///
/// The watch reports device presence; it does not open anything. A device that has just arrived may
/// still refuse to open a session for a moment, and on Android the user may not have granted
/// file-transfer mode yet. Retry with backoff rather than treating the first failure as fatal.
