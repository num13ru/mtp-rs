//! Read a large file window-by-window without monopolizing the MTP session.
//!
//! Demonstrates `Storage::download_windowed`: read a file as a sequence of small
//! bounded windows, and BETWEEN windows run another device operation (a folder
//! listing) to prove the one-per-device PTP session is free the whole time.
//! A plain `download(handle, ByteRange::Full)` would hold that session open for the
//! entire file, so the listing couldn't run until the read finished or was cancelled.
//!
//! Finally it reassembles the windows and verifies they're byte-exact against a
//! plain full download.
//!
//! This runs against the in-process virtual device, so it needs no hardware:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --example windowed_download --features virtual-device
//! ```
