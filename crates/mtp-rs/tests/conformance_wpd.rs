//! Backend-conformance suite for the **Windows WPD backend against a real device**.
//!
//! These run the exact same backend-neutral assertions as `conformance.rs` (the `common::run_*`
//! harness), but pointed at a physical phone over `Backend::Wpd` instead of the virtual device. They
//! parameterize the two backend divergences accordingly:
//!
//! - **Writable parent**: real Android/WPD rejects uploads to the storage root, so every test works
//!   inside a uniquely-named scoped folder created under `Download` (passed as `parent = Some(..)`).
//! - **Upload-cancel partial handle**: WPD commits transactionally, so a cancelled upload leaves no
//!   partial object (`expects_partial = false`), unlike the two-phase USB backend.
//!
//! Each test is `#[ignore]` so a normal `cargo test` run (CI without a phone) skips it; run them
//! locally with a phone connected in MTP/File-transfer mode, screen unlocked:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p mtp-rs --test conformance_wpd -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Every test creates its own scoped folder and deletes it on the way out — on success *or* panic
//! (via `catch_unwind`) — so your real files are never touched and nothing leaks between runs.
